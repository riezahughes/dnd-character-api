# What is this?

A character generator and updater for DnD. At least that's the hope. It'll be a full working api where you can store, retrieve and update characters. There will be a frontend where you can create a character and do the whole level up process in a simple manner using the api to retrieve the relevant information.

Eg: Filter by class and level to get the number of spells. Filter one further and do it by invocation to hunt for specific spell types.

There will also be a section that will scrape from 5e tools to fill out the api's basic information. This can come later thourh. At the moment the priority is just making basic models with prisma 2, setting the skeleton. Making sure you can follow all the simple steps of build a character is mission number 1.

NOTE: THIS IS FOR 5E

# What does it use?

Prisma 2, Node and (hopefully) graphql-yoga once it's running and set up

# Why?

Roll20 broke my sheet and i'm mad.
